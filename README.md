The main purpose of this addon is to download images from tabs more easily.

<b>Features:</b>
- Easy image download from tabs to the left, to the right or only from the current tab.
- Essential settings like auto close tabs, save only the biggest image on the tab, subfolder in the downloads directory and minimum sizes for landscape and portrait images.
- Select links on any page and open them in new tabs, or open and immediately start downloading from these tabs.
- Context menus all over the place for more convenient use.
- One click mode if you need a faster approach.
- Basic duplicate checks, images with identical urls are not saved twice in the same download session.

<b>How to:</b>
- one click - right click on the addon icon (on the toolbar) and select "enable one click mode" (to disable do the same), when enabled you can left click on the addon icon to trigger download of the images (using current settings)
- context menu places - when you right click on any page, on link or selected links, the addon icon.
 
What you  <b>CANNOT</b> do with this addon:
- Multitasking, you need to wait while previous download is finished before starting a new one.
- Download images if they cannot be accessed directly, e.g. protected by authorization, cookies or referrer header  (API limitations).
- Download images to folder of your choice, you can save images only in a subfolder under your firefox downloads directory (API limitations).
- Download dynamic images whose url starts with "data:image..." and not usual https etc.

<b>Default settings:</b>

min portrait size: 56x100px
min landscape size: 100x56px
